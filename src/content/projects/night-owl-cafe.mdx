One of the great features of modern music streaming services is their ability to create playlists using sophisticated algorithms. It's a great way to discover new music adjacent to one's favourite artists.

Sometimes though, you might want to listen to something that's more tailor-made, especially when you're in a particular mood or want to do something specific.

<strong>Night Owl Cafe</strong> is my personal collection of playlists that I've
created for myself, that I am happy to share. It's a place for me to focus
myself for whatever the night may bring.
