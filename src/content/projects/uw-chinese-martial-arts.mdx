The University of Waterloo is home to an incredible club founded by passionate and talented students. I'm grateful to be part of this community â€” not just for the skills I've learned, but for the friendships I've made along the way.

My dear friend <Link href="https://portaly.cc/yenyendesign" className='underline hover:text-green-700 text-green-700/80 decoration-dotted'>@YenYen</Link> designed a beautiful website for the club, and I had the privilege of coding her vision to life.

The site highlights the martial arts that are hosted and practiced, and upcoming events. It serves as a hub for prospective and current members to explore what we do and stay connected with all our activities.
