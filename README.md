# Terrence's Next Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my corner of the web! This is my portfolio that features my work, as well as some Next.js and Sass in action.

## Deployment

This website is hosted on Vercel. The live page can be visited here: https://www.terrencejchan.com/

## Stacks Used

Truthfully, this was my first attempt at using **Next.js** and **Sass**! I had a lot of good fun learning more about this React framework. `@mixins` are pretty damn life-changing too, and I intend to mess around manipulating the breakpoints in the future.

Packages prominently featured are:

- [react-particle-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles-js) npm for the pleasantly animated background.
- [react-hamburger-menu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hamburger-menu) npm for the nice hamburger button and animation.
